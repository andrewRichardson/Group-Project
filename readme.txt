Implementation:

Language:      Matlab
Method:        Function script
How to run:    The program is run in Matlab using a single function called jpegCompression. 
               It takes in a single argument which is a String variable for the path of the
               image to be read into the program.  It then outputs all of the necessary
               information and writes the intermediary step images and the final image using
               prefixes to the image path argument.
